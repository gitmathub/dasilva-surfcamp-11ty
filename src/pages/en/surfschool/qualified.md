Since 2016 the surf classes at the Da Silva Surfcamp are done by our very own Da Silva Surfschool , which is also located on our property and helps beginners and advanced surfers on the board.

Depending on the wave conditions and level of the students, the classes take place at different surf spots a maximum of 20 minutes drive from Praia da Areia Branca. It is important to note that these are beaches which are not as crowded as the famous beaches of Peniche.

The surf courses are usually held from Monday to Friday. However, some sessions may have to be cancelled due to weather or wave conditions. In this case, alternative activities are offered, such as excursions to the surrounding area, SUP sessions, skateboard sessions or similar.

At the end of the complete course (beginner and/or advanced) each student should be able to stand on the board (take-off) or surf in the unbroken part of the wave (green water). The individual successes depend heavily on the motivation, talent and general physical fitness of the student. The price includes bus shuttle, surfboard and wetsuit, theoretical and practical lessons and insurance.
