The Da Silva Surfcamp Portugal is a typical Portuguese country house in a quiet location with wonderful views over the countryside to the sea. Here a shepherd and his flock of sheep pass by twice a day, in the morning you are woken up by the crow of a rooster, otherwise you only hear the birds chirping. 20 minutes walk to the beach, with the beach cruiser, which you can rent for free, it only takes 10 minutes. This house is perfect for people who want to relax and escape the stress of the big city. It is ideal for families with children.
