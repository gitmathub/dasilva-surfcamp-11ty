You get hot? Well then, get on the plane to Lisbon! The 60km to the surf camp can be easily done by express bus to Praia da Areia Branca, where we will pick you up at the bus stop. “Luck is so close”. If this is too stressful for you, you can also use our [airport transfer]({{links.de.travelDirections.path}}).
