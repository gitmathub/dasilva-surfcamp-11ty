## General Information

The nearest airport is in Lisbon, about 65 km south of us. From there you can easily and cheaply take the express bus directly to Praia da Areia Branca, where we will be happy to pick you up from the bus stop. Otherwise you can also hire a car at the airport, take a taxi or use our airport transfer. Unless otherwise agreed with us, arrival and check-in at the Surfcamp is on Sundays and starts at 4 pm and departure is until 12 am. Before and after you can of course put your luggage with us and enjoy the time with us.

## Aerobus

At the airport you take the “Aerobus” (line 2 – Financial Center) to the bus station “Sete Rios”. It goes every 40 minutes and the trip costs 3,50 EUR per person. Tickets for the Aerobus can also be purchased online here: [www.yellowbustours.com](http://www.yellowbustours.com) or directly in the bus.

By the way, the ticket is valid the whole day for all two lines, i.e. if you arrive in the morning, you can make a very cheap detour to the city centre before continuing to Praia da Areia Branca in the afternoon. Directly opposite the bus station “Sete Rios” you can also visit the very beautiful zoo of Lisbon. 

## Expressbus

At the bus station “Sete Rios” you have to buy a ticket to Praia da Areia Branca before getting on the express bus. Under this link you can also buy the tickets online or download the very practical app with which you can save the bus tickets on your smartphone: [www.rede-expressos.pt](http://www.rede-expressos.pt/)

An express bus ride from Lisboa to Praia da Areia Branca costs 8,90 EUR and takes exactly 1 hour and 15 minutes. The end of the line is Peniche. Praia da Areia Branca is the penultimate stop and not a bus station, but only a small inconspicuous bus stop in the middle of Praia da Areia Branca. When you have passed through the district town Lourinha, you have to get off at the next stop.

Best you try to take the bus that arrives in Praia da Areia Branca at 17:00 or 18:15. Then you are just in time for the Welcome-BBQ, which takes place every Sunday.

Attention, you can also take a taxi to the bus station, but you have to be careful not to be cheated. The trip should not cost more than 10 EUR. A tip: Don’t take the taxis waiting at the arrival desk, but go to the departures and take a taxi that just happened to take someone to the airport.

## Airport Transfer

We are also happy to pick you up at any time from Lisbon airport or take you there. This is especially useful if your flight is outside the express bus timetable. Our shuttle bus can accommodate up to 8 people. Please register the airport transfer with us in time and have it confirmed.

## Arrival by car

If you are travelling by car using a navigation device, **please DO NOT navigate to our postal address**! There are **several streets with the same name** in our area and you are therefore often navigated to the wrong address. The safest way to find us is with **Google Maps: “Da Silva Surfcamp”**. If you still use a classic navigation device, please navigate to “**Casal da Murta, Lourinhã**”. There you can easily find the street “Rua Por do Sol” and a sign shows you the way to our surf camp.
