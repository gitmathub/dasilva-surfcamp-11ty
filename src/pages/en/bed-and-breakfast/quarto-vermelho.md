Our largest shared room is located in a separate building just around the corner from the kitchen and diagonally opposite our bar. There are 3 bunk beds in the room and above the bathroom with shower there is a loft bed (gallery) with another single mattress ideal for people over 2 metres tall because the foot end is open. Outside next to the entrance door you can enjoy a wonderful hot shower outdoors while enjoying the view over the wide landscape.
