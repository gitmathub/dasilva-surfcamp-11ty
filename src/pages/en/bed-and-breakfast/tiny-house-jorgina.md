About 20 meters from Da Silva Surfcamp is this separate wooden house, which is ideal for people who want to be part of the social life of a surfcamp, but want to be able to withdraw at any time. The cottage has a very pleasant indoor climate. During the day it does not get too hot and at night the pleasant warmth of the sun stays in the house. In the cottage there is a small television with satellite reception, i.e. you can also watch German television. If you want to cook something, the communal kitchen of the surf camp is at your disposal. On the way there, you will pass directly by our bar, where you can refresh yourself before or after the exhausting kitchen work.
