# A Warm Welcome


The Da Silva Surfcamp Portugal is a typical Portuguese country house in the middle of nature without any road traffic in the immediate vicinity. The property is surrounded by vast fields and from everywhere you have a fantastic view over the green landscape and a wide valley up to the opposite villages. From the huge sun terrace you can comfortably lie in your hammock and see the blue sea and the beach resort Praia da Areia Branca.

In the evening, you can enjoy a wonderful sunset here. There are several beautiful paths through the landscape to the beach, where you can reach it on foot in about 20 minutes. With the beach cruiser, which you can rent for free from us, you don’t need 10 minutes and by car you can reach the beach in 3 minutes. Although you are so close to the Atlantic Ocean, you have the feeling of being somewhere in the country far away from the hustle and bustle of beach life.
