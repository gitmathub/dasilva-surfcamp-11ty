### No Glam

## Just Camping!

#### That’s all there is to it.

## People

Our Surfcamp Portugal is an open house, which means that there is always a lot going on here. Apart from the communal dinners, which are included in the price, we often organize spontaneous barbecues or campfire sessions. Since we are half Portuguese ourselves, friends of ours (locals) come over to sit around the campfire. Then it is not uncommon that suddenly someone takes out a guitar and the evening goes on much longer than planned. But there are also some very nice party-excursions in the surrounding area, to which we would like to take you in our shuttle bus. After all, you should not only learn to surf, but also get to know some of the nice Portuguese nightlife.

## Surroundings

Around the house there is mainly a lot of rustic nature. You can take wonderful walks along the field paths. On the other side of the valley there is the typical farm village “Zambujeira”. There is nothing else except a small café and a mini grocery shop. But it is still worth a visit, as it is really still very original there. Once a year, sometime in August, there is a big village festival, for which even the great-grandmothers dress up. If you want to go out in the evening, you have to go to Praia da Areia Branca or Peniche, but we will take you there with our shuttle bus. So you don’t have to worry, you will certainly not get bored.
