## Leisure

We always offer you the opportunity to do something after surfing. There are almost unlimited offers. There is no fixed program, but we discuss on the camp what you want most. Then we conform to the majority. We take you there with our shuttle bus. All members of the excursion have to pay their own expenses. Everything is voluntary and is arranged spontaneously and individually.

## Sports

Skateboarding, wakeboarding, kite surfing, karting, tennis, golf, diving, horse riding, paragliding and much more. And do not forget to check out our [mountainbiking]({{links.en.mountainBike.path}}) offers. In case the waves are too small or too big, or if it's too stormy or pouring rain and you can't go surfing then the surf courses will canceled due to "force majeure". In such a case, we offer you the above sporting activities as a compensation.
