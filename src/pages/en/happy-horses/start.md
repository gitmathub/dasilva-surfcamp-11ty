## Welcome to HAPPY HORSES

Just 2 km from the beautiful white beaches of Areia Branca, our little Happy Horses herd lives attached to the long-established Da Silva Surf Camp. We are offering you exciting horse-related activities for children, young people, and adults. In addition to pony rides and guided rides, we also offer various interactions that enable you and your children to get to know and understand the lovable creature horse.

It is particularly important to us that humans and horses enjoy working together and have fun working together. We firmly believe that happy horses produce happy people. That is why it is important for us to be friendly with our horses, which are kept in an open stable in a manner appropriate to their species and are continuously trained and further educated to maintain their health. The horses and ponies also want to develop, want to learn, and like and be praised. Come visit us and have fun on horseback or from the ground. You can ride on our riding arena in the Da Silva Surfcamp or enjoy rides in the surrounding nature or to the beaches and lakes or lagoons. Talk to us. We are also happy to plan with you individually so that you can enjoy your vacation and take full advantage of all the region's offers.
