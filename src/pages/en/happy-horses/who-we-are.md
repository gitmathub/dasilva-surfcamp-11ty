We, that's me, Christiane, who as a little girl had already lost her heart to horses and has dreamed of having her own horse ever since. After an artistic career that ended as a production designer for a film, I noticed that something essential had fallen by the wayside because of all the work, and I brought the horses back into my life. Since then I have known what has always been missing.

My love for horses has already paved its way in childhood. For as long as I can remember I have run towards every horse or pony and, if I was allowed to, I preferred to jump on it. I was very lucky to be able to live out this love in my childhood and youth as a riding student and horse care girl in a riding stable near Bonn. I remember all too well how happy it made me clean, maintain, and look after my foxtrot. And of course to ride too. I didn't know fear. And that even though I fell down a lot, I was kicked or bitten.

Somehow I always knew that horses are fundamentally very nice animals, and no matter they do, they don't do it to hurt us. It is more of a miracle and a gift from nature that these large animals willingly join us and are happy to be with us if we treat them kindly and well. This way of handling and a fine and horse-friendly riding style is what I want to convey to children, young people, and adults with my ponies and horses today. And of course, fun and a good mood shouldn't be neglected.

**Jesuli**, my Lusitano gelding, 6 years young and a very fine guy who wants to know exactly who he's dealing with. He looked straight into my heart.

**Kalimero**, a foundling who found me in a roundabout way. He is also 6 years old and an Arab Lusitano Mix. He is very dear and is still at the very beginning of his training.

**Tim√≥l**, an 8 year old Shetty Mix who came to me from a very good training with a young Portuguese. He is the absolute treasure with children and besides riding it is also great fun to work with him from the ground, to play or to go for a walk.

**Zorro**, 16 years old, steals himself into everyone's heart with his imposing appearance, his meter-long mane and his friendly nature.

**Andresch**, my friend, who has preferred to ride waves up to now, but who has grown very fond of horses and who is now looking for happiness on horseback (but only when the waves are bad).
